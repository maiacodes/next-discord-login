# Next Discord Login

**Archival notice:** Please do not use this in production. This is just a simple demo to show how you can use API routes w/ Next. I am not going to be updating this repo or responding to comments or issues about it anymore.

## About
This is a demo of how you can use [Next.js](https://nextjs.com) to allow users to login with an OAuth2 service. This demo is setup to use Discord login. It uses Next's API routes system. I'll write comments/document this better in the future, but for now it's scrapped together as an example. 

## Demo
You can see it in action here: https://next-discord-login.vercel.app/
